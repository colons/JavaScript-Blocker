				JavaScript Blocker keeps you safe on the web by preventing
				tracking agencies, social networks, and generally bad places from loading on webpages. There are also some other features
				that can make your browsing experience more enjoyable. In this manual you will learn about every aspect of
				JavaScript Blocker.
			</p>

			<p>A predefined set of rules—the whitelist and blacklist—is automatically installed to help with allowing or
				blocking "safe" or "bad" items. If you want to ignore either or both of these lists, you can do so via the
				extension's settings page. Theese lists utilize the power of
				<a href="https://easylist.adblockplus.org/en/" target="_blank">EasyList</a> and

		<header id="rules"><h3>Features</h3></header>

		<section>
			<p class="no-padding">The extension controls which resources are allowed or blocked based on the domain of the webpage
				and the source of the item in question. There are several blockers included to control almost anything on a webpage.
				Only the script, frame, and XHR blockers are enabled by default. Each one has its own default action which can be configured
				from the settings page under <b>Rules</b>. 
			</p>

			<article>
				<section>
					<header><h4>Methods of Action</h4></header>
			
					<p>Any rule created can be permanent or temporary. A temporary rule is one that will be automatically removed when Safari is restarted.</p>
					<p>Rules can be created to always block scripts if they originate from a different hostname, from a different sub-domain, anywhere, or the blacklist only.</p>
					<p>Let's say I choose to block rules if they come from a different hostname. Now, I navigate to example.org and it attempts to load a resource from example.com—a different hostname—a rule is created to block any resource originating from example.com on example.org. But if example.org tries loading a resource from sub.example.org, it will be allowed since it is a sub-domain of example.org. This is possible by selecting "Different hostnames" from the preferences for "Block * from:".</p>
					<p>If you wanted to allow resources only from the same originating hostname, choose "Different hosts & subdomains" instead. Then, even a resource from sub.example.org will be blocked.</p>
					<p>If you wanted to block everything, select "Anywhere".</p>
					<p>If you wanted to block only known bad scripts, select "Blacklist only".</p>
				</section>
			</article>

			<article>
				<section>
					<header><h4>Script Blocker</h4></header>

					<p>One of the most important aspects of the extension is its ability to block scripts. By default, the extension
						will block any script contained within the blacklist. This means that
						you are automatically protected from tracking agencies, advertisers, social networks, etc.</p>
					<p>Scripts are considered to be any resource loaded using a <b><code>&lt;script&gt;</code></b> tag. Scripts that
						are not loaded from somewhere and are not using a data URI cannot be blocked. Unfortunately this is a limitation of Safari
						extensions. This is mostly not an issue as harmful/unwanted scripts will most likely be loaded from a file.</p>
				</section>

				<p>The following blockers are part of the extra features of the extension.</p>

				<section>
					<header><h4>Frame Blocker</h4></header>

					<p>The extension can also prevent <b><code>&lt;frameset&gt;</code></b>s and <b><code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code></b>s
						from being loaded. These are often used to place ads or social networks on webpages because the frame itself will
						be from the host of the ad or social network. For example, if I go to <b>www.example.com</b> and they have a frame
						that loads Facebook, without the frame blocker, I would still see all of Facebook stuff and they can still track
						where you've been. A placeholder can be used to load a specific frame by clicking on it.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<header><h4>XHR Blocker</h4></header>

					<p>XHR stands for XML HTTP Request and is a technogloy that webpages use to load or transfer information from/to a server
						in the background. Blocking these requests from being made can further improve your security by not allowing webpages
						to post information without you knowing about it. By default, only items on the blacklist will be blocked. This blocker
						comes with an additional option: ask when neccessary. When enabled, you will be prompted to allow/deny XHR requests
						as they happen.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<header><h4>Embed and Object Blocker</h4></header>

					<p><b><code>&lt;embed&gt;</code></b>s and <b><code>&lt;object&gt;</code></b>s can be things like Flash, Java, etc.
						By default, these elements are blocked regardless of where they originate from. A placeholder can be used to load
						a specific embed or object by clicking on it.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<header><h4>Video Blocker</h4></header>

					<p>This will block only HTML5 <b><code>&lt;video&gt;</code></b> elements. To block Flash videos, use the <b>Embed and
						Object Blocker</b>. All videos are blocked by default. A placeholder can be used to load a specific video by clicking on it.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<header><h4>Image Hider</h4></header>

					<p><b>Images will only be prevented from appearing on the webpage.</b> Unfortunately they will still be downloaded, though
						you will never see them. This is a limitation of WebKit, the engine behind Safari. All images are allowed by default regardless of where
						they are from. A placeholder can be used to view specific images by clicking on it.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<header><h4>Other Features</h4></header>

					<p>The extension can also help block some JavaScript annoyances and help with reading webpages. They can be enabled
						one-by-one under <b>Other Features</b> on the settings page. With the exception of the first three items, they act
						just like a blocker so you can create rules for them on a per-domain basis. If the feature is active, it will appear
						as a blocked item under <b>OTHER</b> in the main window. The text below appearing in <b>bold</b> will be the name
						of the item as it appears in the window.</p>

					<ul>
						
						<li><p>When navigating to a short URL, you can choose to see what the URL will expand into and confirm if you want
							to continue or not.</p></li>
						<li><p>An experimental feature to block all referrer information for GET requests in the main window when just preventing
							links from sending it isn't enough.</p></li>
						
						<li><p><b>Links sending referrers</b></p><p>Prevent links on webpages from sending referrer information so the destination will not know where you are
							coming from.</p>
							<section>
								<p>Adds the attribute <b><code>rel="noreferrer"</code></b> to anchor elements.</p>
							</section>
						</li>
						<li><p><b>Modal alert dialogs</b></p><p>Alert dialogs can be displayed within the webpage instead of a standard modal
							dialog so they don't get in your way. Multiple alerts will stack and can be closed by swiping to the right or clicking the
							close button.</p></li>
						<li><p><b>Context menu overrides</b></p><p>Ensure that right-clicking on a webpage will always work as intended and that other extensions will not be able
							to fill up the context menu.</p></li>
						<li><p><b>Window resize functions</b></p><p>Prevent webpages from changing the size of your browser window or opening a new window with a custom size.</p>
							<section>
								<p>These functions are overwritten: <code>resizeBy, resizeTo, moveTo, open</code>.
							</section>
						</li>
						<li><p><b>Autocomplete disablers</b></p><p>Make sure forms are always able to autocomplete even if they set <b><code>autocomplete="off"</code></b>.</p></li>
						<li><p><b>Inline script execution</b></p><p>Prevent scripts that are embedded into the webpage from executing.</p>
							<section>
								<p>Injects the following meta tag into the webpage:<br/><br/>
									<code>&lt;meta http-equiv="content-security-policy" content="default-src *; script-src *; style-src * \'unsafe-inline\'; object-src *" /&gt;</code><br/><br/></p>
							</section>
						</li>
						<li><p><b>Default webpage font</b></p><p>Force webpages to use a custom font so you'll always be able to read the content.</p></li>
						<li><p><b>Default webpage zoom level</b></p><p>Automatically zoom in on webpages if you have trouble seeing them.</p>
							<section>
								<p>Adds a <code>zoom</code> CSS property to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element.</p>

		<header id="snapshots"><h3>Snapshots</h3></header>

		<section>
			<p class="no-padding"</p>Snapshots is one of the extension's extra features that automatically creates backups
				of your rules any time they are modified. You can use it to recover from any accidental changes or to create
				different rule sets for different situations, such as when you're at home or in public.</p>
			<p>You can access the snapshots UI from the rule list by clicking the time machine icon in the actions bar.</p>
			<aside>
				<div class="crop inline" style="width: 20px; height: 18px;">
					<img class="inline" src="images/rule-list-normal.png" height="354" width="464" style="margin: -95px 0 0 -212px;" />
				</div>
			</aside>
			<p>Once opened, you will see a summary of how many snapshots there are and how much space they are using. You can limit
				the amount of <b>UNKEPT</b> snapshots from the settings page.</p>
			<aside>
				<img class="thumb" src="images/snapshots.png" width="232" height="177" />
			</aside>
			<p>When you first start off, there will only be snapshots under <b>UNKEPT</b> since they are not saved permanently by
				default. Clicking <b>Create Snapshot</b> will create a new, unnamed <b>KEPT</b> snapshot with the current date and time.</p>

			<article>
				<section>
					<header><h4>Snapshot Previews</h4></header>

					<p>You can preview a snapshot's rules (i.e. temporarily use them in place of the current rule set) by clicking <b>Preview</b>.
						This will take you back to the rule list where you will see see all of the rules in the snapshot. The active preview will be
						green in the snapshots UI.</p>
					<p>You can browse around as you normally would to see the rules in action. You will not be able to create or remove
						any rules while the preview is in use—snapshots are read-only.</p>
					<p>From the rule list, you can recover rules to place them in the current rule set by clicking the <b>Recover</b>
						button next to a rule, where <b>Delete</b> would normally be. You can also recover entire domain
						sets by switching to edit mode (click the little pencil icon in the actions bar). A <b>Recover</b> button will
						appear next to the domain name. Clicking it will reveal two options: Merge and Replace. Use <b>Merge</b> when you want
						append the current rules for that domain and <b>Replace</b> to use only the snapshot's version of the domain rules
						(the current rules for that domain will be removed).</p>
					<p>Click the time machine icon again to reveal a popup with <b>Merge Rules</b> and <b>Replace Rules</b>. Use <b>Merge</b>
						when you want to append your current rule set with rules unique to the snapshot and <b>Replace</b> to turn the snapshot
						into the current rule set. You can also click <b>Close Snapshot</b> to revert back to the current rule set.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<header><h4>Snapshot Options</h4></header>

					<p>Click on a snapshot's name to reveal a popup.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p><b>Name</b> lets you give the snapshot a custom name. You cannot use the same name twice. Names are case sensitive
							so "Standard" is not the same as "standard".</p></li>
						<li class="header"><b>Compare</b> opens a popup with three ways you can compare the snapshot to the current rule set.
							A comparison can be acted upon just like a preview, but unlike previews, they will last only until the rule list is closed. 
							Until then, the rules resulting from the comparison will be used in place of the current rules.</li>
						<li>
							<ul>
								<li><p><b>Only in Snapshot</b> will show rules in the snapshot that are not in the current rules.</p></li> 
								<li><p><b>Not in Snapshot</b> will show rules in the current rules which are not in the snapshot.</p></li>
								<li><p><b>In Both</b> will show rules that are in both the current rules and the snapshot.</p></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><p><b>Keep</b> saves the snapshot permanently; it will not be deleted as part of the automatic purge.</p></li>
						<li><p><b>Unkeep</b> will allow the snapshot to be removed as part of the automatic purge.</p></li>

		<header id="user-scripts"><h3>User Scripts</h3></header>

		<section>
			<p class="no-padding">You can can inject user scripts into webpages to have total control over them. When creating a script, there
				is no need to include the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag.
			<p>Injected scripts can communicate with JavaScript Blocker to perform special functions such as adding a rule or
				creating custom context menu items. Most custom greasemonkey functions (GM_* functions) are supported with the exception of GM_setClipboard.
				GM_xmlhttpRequest will allow cross-domain requests.</p>
			<p>When viewing a script ending with <b>.user.js</b>, a prompt will appear to let you add it to JavaScript Blocker.</p>
			<p>Once a new script is created, rules will be automatically created based on the @match and @include directives. You can also create your own
				rules to enable it on a per-site basis or create a rule to enable it everywhere.</p>
			<p>If a script contains both an @updateURL and @downloadURL directive, automatic updating and developer mode can be enabled. New updates will be
				checked for every 5 days.</p>
			<p>When developer mode is used, the script (and all of its requirements and resources) are re-downloaded anytime a webpage is loaded, even if it's not a newer version. For
				technical reasons, changes to any resources or requirements in use by the script will be refelected on the second page reload.</p>
